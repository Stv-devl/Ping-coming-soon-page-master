## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- Javascript

### What I learned

For this exercice i learned to validate an Email form with Javascipt.
=> When we have a typing error we will have an error message and the border will be red
=> When the form is empty we will have a different error message and the border will be red
=> When the email is good we will have a thank you message and the border will be green

### Continued development

Next step will be to validate a form more complex. And improve my JS of course.
